# Mobile Test Task

We really appreciate your time and effort spent on this exercise!

Here is what we would like you to do:
1. Develop a simple mobile application in Flutter.
2. Capture your thoughts and ideas on how to evolve the application going forward.

## Application Requirements

* The application should provide the ability for users to register in the system. It should be accomplished via a wizard consisting of 4 pages. 
* The wizard should have the following pages: "Landing", "Personal Data", "Make a Selfie", "Summary".

* When launching the application for the first time, a user should be navigated to the first page of the wizard.
* A user should be able to go back to the previous page desirably by swiping from the left to right.
* Basic validation should be incorporated in the Personal Data page (e.g. only adults are allowed to register, email follows a certain pattern, passpords match and follow basic security rules). 
* Residence is a required parameter, which represents a country from which a user claims to be. Populate it by pulling data off any public service such as https://restcountries.eu/. 
* The "Summary" page will show consolidate the data that was entered in the previous pages. 
* The application should be structured in a such a way that it could be easily extended to a mid-sized application. There will be several engineers working on it simultaneosly. 
* The application will evolve into a Mobile Wallet application that allows transfering funds between different cryptoledgers as well as working with bank accounts, credit / debit cards, making trades, placing orders to buy ETFs, etc.
* Please pick a proper state management library and share your ideas if this decision needs to be revisited going forward.
* Write a couple of tests (unit / widget / integration / etc) to demostrate the approach you would recommend to follow.
* Preselecting a residence country using geolocation will be a plus.
